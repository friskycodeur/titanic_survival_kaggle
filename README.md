When I started doing this analysis my main goal was getting experience. I'm still learning and trying to improve my skills, so there is a great chance that there will be some areas for improvement.

In this notebook I will show you how a beginner (in this case ,me) approached the Titanic Survival prediction problem.I read a lot of notebooks of very experienced and helpful kagglers and watched some videos on youtube for better understanding. So without further ado , let's get this started!

### Here are the things I will try to cover in this Notebook:

- What is the survival rate for specific groups?
- Is there any relation between given info of passengers and their survival?
- Was women and children first policy in order?
- Having higher social status in helped people getting in life boats?
- The mustering order from captain was highly dependent on the class of the passengers, can we spot this  effect between pclass and the survival rates?
- What are the effects of family size?

- Can we predict if a passenger survived from the disaster with using machine learning techniques?
